# Neural Network Model for Predicting Whether Customers Will Subscribe to Term Deposit Products in Portuguese Banking Institution

## Introduction
Term deposits are one of the products that are usually found in banking. In Portuguese banking institutions, these products are marketed by telephone. The dataset consist of marketing history data such as customer personal data such as age and type of work, and marketing data such as duration of calls and the results of the marketing itself, namely whether the customer has subscribed to a time deposit or not. With this data, we can build machine learning models to predict the likelihood that a customer will subscribe so that marketing can be more targeted.

## project Scope
The project includes a neural network machine learning model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a time deposit product using the Tensorflow library and other supporting libraries. The data set used is a data set from UCI Bank Marketing Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).
